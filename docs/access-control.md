# Access Control

Login can be controlled to specific Service Providers (SP) based on Craft 
user groups. These controls are found under the "Configure" tab in the SP configuration. 
A number of combinations can be used but "Allow Any" and "No Group Assigned" are checked 
first, in that order.

## Allow Any
Toggling "Allow Any" will let any user login to the SP.

## No Group Assigned
Toggle "No Group Assigned" to allow users to login who are not associated to any 
Craft user groups. 


## Allow Access by User Groups
For more granular control over login, toggle user groups to allow access. The user 
only needs to be apart of one of the allowed groups to gain access.
